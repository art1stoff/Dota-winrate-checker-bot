- For the bot to work correctly, you need to activate access to message content via intents.message_content.

### 🚀 Usage

```bash
python main.py
```
- In the Discord channel where the bot is activated, enter the command:
```bash
!hero <hero name>
```

### ⬇️ Installation

- Make sure you have Python 3.8+ and required libraries installed.
- Install the required libraries
```bash
pip install discord.py requests
```
- Put your Discord token in the code instead of 'TOKEN' (find the line client.run('TOKEN')).
